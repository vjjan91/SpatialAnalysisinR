# SpatialAnalysisinR
This repository hosts scripts and information for the 'Spatial Analysis in R' workshop at SCCS-NY 2018.

## Instructions

In this repository, you will find scripts and data for the workshop.

1.	Please bring your own device, preferably with R/RStudio installed.
2.	I have added sample data, which will be used during the workshop. Alternately, you are more than welcome to bring your own data and play around with it during the workshop.  

## Details

This workshop will cover the basics in spatial analysis within the R programming environment. Topics covered include basic spatial operations and storage of data, vector and raster manipulation, packages and functions that offer tools analogous to ones offered in QGIS/ArcGIS and basics of static mapping.  

Basic knowledge of R and Spatial Analysis is required. 

*Caveat*: By no means is this workshop meant to cover all possible types of spatial analyses within R, but the hope is to provide a glimpse of analyses possible. Further, this workshop is meant to cater to users with differing levels of experience in R and spatial analysis and is not meant to be for users with advanced experience in spatial analysis in R.
